  "description": "Matter Live is Matter DeFiâ€™s farm-as-a-service (FaaS) tool. With the FaaS tool, people can create their own custom farms with their choice of tokens. For example, if you develop a new project that has its own token & you wish to incentivize providing liquidity for it or if you wish to distribute the token, you can create a farm that emits your project token to people who provide liquidity for it and stake their LP tokens in the farm.",
