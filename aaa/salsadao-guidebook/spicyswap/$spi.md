# 1.9 $SPI Utility Token & Fee Farming

![alt text](/img/spi.png)

    What is Spice Fee Farming?

Another one of Spicyswap’s unique features is the $SPI utility token. As mentioned in section 1.7, a 0.2% fee on all swaps is paid to liquidity providers, but an additional 0.1% swap fee is paid out to the $SPI fee farms. With the $SPI token, users can farm an additional 0.1% on all swap fees. This is called Spice farming.

Fee farming with $SPI/$WTZ SSLP tokens is a unique part of Spicyswap’s value proposition as it essentially allows users to develop unique farming strategies where they can collect fees on a pair without having to be exposed to the volatility of the underlying assets in that pair. In other words, users get to collect fees on a pair they are not themselves adding liquidity to which effectively allows them to avoid the impermanent loss that comes with being a liquidity provider. It also opens up the door to conservative fee farming strategies where users can remain in pairs that show consistent, yet steady volume activity, or users can be more adventurous and chase high volume liquidity (on newly launched tokens, e.g.).

    Getting Started

1. To begin Spice farming, you will need to first mint $SPI/$WTZ SSLP tokens by adding liquidity to the $SPI/$WTZ pool. (For instructions on how to add liquidity, see section 1.7.)

 So-called “Spice fees”, and the APR on Spice fees, can be viewed on the analytics page at the far right of the ‘Pools’ table.

    Finding the Farm Page

2. After minting $SPI/$WTZ SSLP tokens, users will navigate to the Spice Fee Farm page either by navigating directly to the Spice Fee Farm page by clicking ‘Farm’ on the Spicyswap landing page in the 'Farming Opportunities' section:

    Unstake SSLP

7. If you ever wish to unstake your $SPI/$WTZ SSLP from the Spice Fee Farm, simply input the amount you wish to remove and click ‘Unstake’:

:::tip Note!

Important to note is that claimable Spice Fee rewards do not update until SSLP is either minted or burned for the pair one is staked in. So, for example, if I am staking my $SPI/$WTZ SSLP in the $SDAO/$WTZ pool, my claimable rewards will not update until more $SDAO/$WTZ SSLP is minted or burned, no matter the amount. Sometimes users will trigger the Spice Fee rewards update by adding small amounts to the liquidity pool they are staked in. Rewards are paid out in SSLP tokens of the pair in which one is farming.

:::

As mentioned above, the amount of Spice Farm fees collected in a 24hr period as well as the APR for the Spice fee can always be viewed on the analytics page to the right of the ‘Pools’ table.
