# 1.6 Adding Liquidity

Spicyswap liquidity providers earn 0.2% on swap fees, and another 0.1% can be gained by fee farming with the $SPI utility token (more on this in [section 1.10](/$spi)).

    Adding Liquidity

1. To add or remove liquidity from Spicyswap, after you’ve opened the app, make sure to toggle on the ‘Liquidity’ option. (This is usually the default page that is opened upon initially opening Spicyswap.)

2. To add liquidity, first select the pair you wish to add by clicking on the token ticker icons and selecting from the options in the drop down bar:

    Mint SSLP

3. After selecting the pair, input the amount you wish to add by manually putting in a value for one of the assets. The DEX should auto-fill the other side of the pair to match in proportion. The interface will display the amount of SSLP tokens (pool shares) your inputted values will mint. (These SSLP tokens are your receipt for what you’ve put into the pool and can be used for staking in a yield farm.)

4. If things look correct, click the ‘Mint’ button at the bottom.

(You can manually adjust the slippage rate by selecting one of the percentage options directly above the ‘Mint’ button, e.g. .1% or .3%)
