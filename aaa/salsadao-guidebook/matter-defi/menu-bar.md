    Selecting a New Node

4. If for any reason you ever need to change nodes (say because you are experiencing issues getting a transaction applied), you can select between a set of built-in options by navigating to the ‘Change Node’ page.

Users also have the option to manually input the URL to a node of their choice by selecting the custom option. Once the URL has been input, click the ‘Update’ button:
