2. After clicking ‘Remove’, a box will pop-up where users can input a value for the amount of SSLP tokens they wish to unstake. The box will also display the 5% staking fee that will be taken by the contract for the purposes of buying back and burning $MTTR.

If everything looks good, click the ‘Unstake’ button. Once you approve the transaction and the transaction is applied, your SSLP will show up in your wallet.
