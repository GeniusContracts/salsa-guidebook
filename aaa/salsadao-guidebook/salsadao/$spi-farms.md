    Filters

3. At the top of the page, there are various filters for the farms (from left to right): liquidity mining, simple staking, circular farm, and clear. These filters will display the various farms that correspond to each category. But it is also worth noting that if you ever run into issues displaying your staked balance or claimable rewards, simply move the filters off of ‘clear’ (for example, click ‘liquidity mining’). This should help to re-display your balances.
