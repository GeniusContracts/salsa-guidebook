# 4.5 Governance & Voting

$sDAO is the SalsaDAO governance token, and all Genius Contracts products are governed by $sDAO holders. The governance process starts by taking ideas that consistently come up in informal discord discussions into the salsaDAO governance [forum](https://forum.salsadao.xyz/), where the ideas can get discussed in more detail. After relative consensus is reached on the discussion forum, a proposal is drafted and put on the SalsaDAO website voting portal where all active issues up for voting can be viewed.

:::tip Note!

To participate in governance discussions, be sure to create your account on the [SalsaDAO governance forum](https://forum.salsadao.xyz/).

:::

    $sDAO

1. To participate in the SalsaDAO voting process, first users will have to get $sDAO either by purchasing some on Spicyswap or farming some on the SalsaDAO farm page. (For more information on swaps, see [Spicyswap Docs, section 1.4](/swaps) for more information on SalsaDAO farming, see [SalsaDAO Docs, section 4.](/$spi-farms))

    Curve Voting & Token Whitelisting

4. At the top right, there is a link to an FAQ on curve voting, a vote weighting mechanism that SalsaDAO governance utilizes.

5. Under the Active Votes category, you will be able to see a description of what is being voted on, as well as some stats about total amount of $sDAO locked in the votes, the total amount of voting power that has been curved by $sDAO timelocking, average multiplier, and the minimum amount of time that a vote can be locked up for. Locking one’s vote for a long period of time “curves” one’s vote such that they give their $sDAO more voting power.

To vote, click ‘Vote’.

6. In this particular example, the vote is for Spicyswap whitelisted tokens. Anyone with $sDAO can add a token to the whitelist which pushes it to the top of the token swap options on spicyswap. To vote for a toke, input the token contract address and select the amount of $sDAO you wish to vote with. 

Below there is an option to increase the amount of time you wish to lock your $sDAO, which, again, by locking your vote for longer, your $sDAO is curved to have more voting power.

    Leaderboard

7. To view the leaderboard of current tokens that have been voted on for whitelisting, close out of the voting box and click on ‘View Leaderboard’.

There is again the option to vote at the top of the leaderboard.
