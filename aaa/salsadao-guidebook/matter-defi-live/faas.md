    Farm as a Service

Matter Live is Matter DeFiâ€™s farm-as-a-service (FaaS) tool. With the FaaS tool, people can create their own custom farms with their choice of tokens. For example, if you develop a new project that has its own token & you wish to incentivize providing liquidity for it or if you wish to distribute the token, you can create a farm that emits your project token to people who provide liquidity for it and stake their LP tokens in the farm. 

In addition to making farm creation easy, this tool expands the set of farming options available on Matter DeFi for users. Matter Live allows for LP farming, as well a simple one token staking. Any LP can work, but the UI supports & displays Spicyswap Liquidity (SSLP) farms.
