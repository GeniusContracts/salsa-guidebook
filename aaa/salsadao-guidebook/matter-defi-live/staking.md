5. If the farm requires you to stake SSLP, you will need to first mint some by adding liquidity to the pair on Spicyswap. You can navigate to the liquidity adding page on Spicyswap by clicking on the ‘Get WTZ/token’ button in the farm box. (For more on adding liquidity to Spicyswap or minting SSLP, see [Spicyswap Docs, section 1.6](/addliquidity))

Add to the farm by selecting the green ‘Add’ button. Selection the amount in the popup box. Once the amount is set, click ‘Stake’ & approve the transaction.

There is a 1% fee taken from your input value upon staking. This fee is taken by the Matter DeFi contract and used to buy back and then burn MTTR.

    Farm Balance

6. Once you have staked in the farm, the farm display box should update and preview the amount you have staked, as well as your % share of the farm and this value denominated in XTZ.
