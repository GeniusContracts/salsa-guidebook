# SpicyPro Recipes

SpicyPro Recipes are custom contracts made to help users execute multi-step actions in 1-click.

Recipes help to enhance UX by offering 1-step & XTZ-based onboarding to Spicy's best features. Check out our current Recipe list!

## Swap & Mint

<p align="center"><img src="/img/spro-rec-s-n-m.jpg" /></p>

This recipe will convert a token of your choosing into a SpicySwap Liquidity Pool token via combination swap & mint.

Approximately half of the input token will be converted to the other pooled token, and then both tokens will be used to mint SSLP tokens.

This action is optimized by a smart contract to be gas and economically efficient. Cumulative slippage is applied over the whole recipe.

## Swap & Mint & Stake

This is a variant of the above recipe, where the resulting SPI/WTZ LP is additionally staked into Spice Farming. Navigate to the "Farm" tab and use "Stake with XTZ" to access this variant.

This allows you to enter into a Spice Farming position in one step using single-sided XTZ, WTZ, or SPI.

## Burn & Swap

<p align="center"><img src="/img/spro-rec-b-n-s.jpg" /></p>

This recipe will remove SpicySwap Liquidity Pool tokens from a pool of your choice, and convert all recieved funds to one token via combination burn & swap.

SSLP tokens will be burnt for an equal share of the two pooled tokens, then a swap is executed to convert both to one token.

This action is optimized by a smart contract to be gas and economically efficient. Cumulative slippage is applied over the whole recipe.

## Unstake & Burn & Swap

This is a variant of the above recipe, where SPI/WTZ LP is unstaked from Spice Farming before execution. Navigate to the "Farm" tab and use "Unstake to XTZ" to access this variant.

This allows you to completely exit a Spice Farming position in one step, resulting in single-sided XTZ, WTZ, or SPI.
