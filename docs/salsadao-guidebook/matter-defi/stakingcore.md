    Staking & Minting SSLP

2. In order to stake in any of the active farms, users will need to first mint SSLP tokens for the pair they wish to farm. To do so, users will need to add liquidity to the pair on Spicswap by clicking the ‘Get LP Tokens’ button will which will quickly navigate them to the liquidity management page on Spicyswap.

:::tip Note!
