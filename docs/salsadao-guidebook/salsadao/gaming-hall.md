    Gaming Hall

1. The SalsaDAO has a gaming hall with a selection of Casino style games that are executed on-chain. To navigate to the gaming hall, click the ‘Gaming’ button on the navigation bar at the top of the page.

    Placing a Bet

You’ll then be prompted to select how many numbers of the dice you wish to bet on and the amount you wish to bet. Betting on less numbers will pay out higher rewards. After inputting those values, click ‘Make’ to place the bet. Approve the transaction.

    Betting On-chain

6. For each bet placed, a secret is stored on your local device, and a secret hash is sent to the contract. This is what determines the outcome of the bet upon revealing the secret key. If there is a match, you win; if there is no match between the two, you lose.

    Bet Status & Canceling a Bet

7. When the bet has been applied to the blockchain, the gaming hall will display the status of your bet, as well as all previous bets. For the most recent bet applied, the card will show that it is “awaiting house”, which means that it is waiting for the house to pick up the bet. To cancel the bet and revert your payment, press ‘Cancel’.

8. Once the house has picked up the bet, click ‘Resolve’ to reveal the outcome and see if you won.

    Invest in Bankroll to Earn Interest on House Edge

9. Another interesting aspect of the gaming hall is that users create the bankrolls from which winning bets are payed out from. By contributing to bankroll liquidity, users earn interest derived from the built in house-edge.

To add liquidity to one of the bankrolls, choose the currency you wish to add to, and then click on the ‘Invest’ button.

10. Upon clicking ‘Invest’, you will be prompted to specify the amount you wish to invest. Input the amount, and click ‘Invest Tokens’. After doing so, you will be issued SalsaDAO Bankroll Tokens (SBT) similar to the way providing liquidity on a DEX issues you liquidity pool tokens. To divest your shares, simply choose to divest at the bottom.
