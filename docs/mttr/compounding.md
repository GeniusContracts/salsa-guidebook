# Compounding Rewards

## MTTR-->MTTR Compound Staking

Matter DeFi offers a single staking MTTR→MTTR farm, where users have the option to simply stake their $MTTR tokens to receive more $MTTR. Additionally, Matter DeFi offers a function which allows users to send any of the claimable rewards directly to the MTTR→MTTR farm. This function is called ‘compounding’.

1. To start compounding $MTTR rewards, simply click the ‘Compound’ button to the right of the ‘Claim’ button.

2. A box will pop up that describes the action and asks you to confirm. To confirm, press the ‘Compound’ button in the pop-up box. This will issue a transaction approval request from your wallet.

Once you approve and the transaction is applied, your $MTTR tokens will show up in your MTTR→MTTR farm balance.
