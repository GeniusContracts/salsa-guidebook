# Matter DeFi Analytics

## Watch the Burn

1. The total amount of $MTTR emitted to $MTTR burned through buy backs is displayed at the top of the Matter DeFi homepage. (Be sure to follow the [Matter Burn Bot](https://twitter.com/MatterBurnBot) on twitter to stay up-to-date with burns in real time!)

## Farm Balance, APR, and TVL

All farms stats will be displayed on each farm box respectively, such as: 1) the amount of $MTTR a farm emits per day, 2) current APR on a farm, the total value locked in that farm, denominated in XTZ, 4) a user’s current staked balance, and 5) a user’s current unclaimed rewards.
