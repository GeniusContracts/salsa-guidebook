## What is SpicySwap?

SpicySwap is a next-generation DEX built by [Genius Contracts](https://geniuscontracts.medium.com/) specifically for token-to-token swaps on Tezos. SpicySwap is governed by [SalsaDAO](https://salsadao.xyz/) ($sDAO), which is the governance entity for the wider suite of Genius Contracts platforms and products. SpicySwap is heavily inspired by Uniswap, and was built from the ground up for Tezos. 

Use this site to find information and tutorials on how to swap, manage liquidity, and participate in the protocol-level Spice ($SPI) Farms.
