![alt text](/img/salsadaobanner.jpeg)

SalsaDAO is the community organization that governs all of the products released by Genius Contracts, including the Spicyswap DEX, Matter DeFi, the SalsaDAO Gaming Hall, and more as the ecosystem continues to grow.

The purpose of this documentation is to navigate through all of the UI aspects of each SalsaDAO ecosystem product, including: [Spicyswap DEX](/spicyswap), [SpicyPro](/spro), [Matter DeFi (Core)](/matter-defi), [Matter DeFi (Live)](/faas), & the [SalsaDAO governance portal](/salsadao).

First stop: [SalsaDAO](/salsadao)!
