## Objkt Delay

On the bottom of the detailed NFT view, you'll see **Objkt Delay** which is simply how far Objkt API data is behind our data. 

As we are using an external service, we don't have access to underlying indexers or golden source data, so there is a small delay before the data flows all the way through to SalsaDAO.

Our plan is to develop our own marketplace contracts in the future to simplify the experience for our users.

## Royalties

Royalties are split 50/50 between Genius Contracts and the SalsaDAO community (via Royalty Staking).
