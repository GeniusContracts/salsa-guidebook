## Unminted Item

Once the operation is confirmed, you will see new unminted items in your inventory. At this stage, no more interaction is required. Genius Contracts' MintBot will enrich your token with RNG bytes to create your NFT. This process can only happen once.

MintBot mints tokens from first purchaser to last purchaser. If there are purchasers in front of you, you may have to wait a bit for the mint.

## Minted Item

MintBot will get to your unminted NFT, and then pay the gas to enrich it with metadata. After this is complete, the NFT is immutable and can never be changed. You'll see the new NFT in your inventory. Try equipping your new NFT to your nametag!
