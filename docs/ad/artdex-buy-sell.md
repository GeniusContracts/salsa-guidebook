# Buying & Selling NFTs

:::tip 

Prices displayed on ArtDEX include all fees.

There are multiple ways to interact with ArtDEX pools, whether you are **buying NFTs** from pools or **selling NFTs** to pools. Let's start with the simplest cases.

## Optimized Buy & Sell

<p align="center"><img src="/artdex-cxn.png" /></p>

Buying NFTs on ArtDEX is a simple process due to our unique NFT trading interface. After you use our [search & discovery](/artdex-markets) tools to find a market, you'll end up on a collection market page.

### Optimized Buy

<p align="center"><img src="/artdex-cxn-buy.png" /></p>

Use the **Buy** tab to find items ready for immediate purchase. The ArtDEX Interface automatically looks through all the pools and finds the lowest price items for purchase.

All you have to do is **click or tap** your desired item, and it will be placed in your cart for purchase. 

You'll notice that prices may change as you add items to your cart. This is by design. Liquidity providers can set custom pricing curves on their trading pools, which change the NFT price as items are bought or sold.

### Optimized Sell

Selling on ArtDEX is also optimized. When you enter a collection market, your NFTs will automatically be loaded in the **Sell** tab. 

The ArtDEX Interface will automatically check pools to find the **best offer** for your NFTs. If there is an offer, the price will show under your NFT.

To instantly sell an item, simply **click or tap** on the NFT in the Sell tab. A sell order will be added to your cart, similar to the buying process.

### Checkout

Feel free to browse and add items from different collections around ArtDEX. Once you are ready to purchase, open up the cart using the button on the top right.

Your optimized ArtDEX trades will be under their own category, separate from any general transactions like pool creation or casino games.

Review your cart, and click **Execute** when you are ready to send the transaction to the Tezos network.

From this point on, the process is similar to any other transaction using your Tezos wallet.

## Direct Buy & Sell

You also have the choice to interact **directly** with pools that other users created on ArtDEX. This may be helpful if you want a rarer item that may be priced differently than other items.

To find pools, use the **Pools** tab and click or tap on a pool to view its details.

<p align="center"><img src="/artdex-pool-detail.png" /></p>

In pool details, find the **About** box to see a simple description of the pool's trading parameters. You may directly buy NFTs from the pool or sell NFTs to the pool here.

### Direct Buy

<p align="center"><img src="/artdex-buy-form.png" /></p>

Once you open up the **Direct Buy** form, select the items that you'd like to buy. Then click "Purchase Now" and a bulk purchase order will be added to your transaction cart.

### Direct Sell

<p align="center"><img src="/artdex-sell-form.png" /></p>

Once you open up the **Direct Sell** form, your held NFTs will automatically be loaded. Select the items you'd like to sell, then confirm, and a bulk sell order will be added to your transaction cart.
