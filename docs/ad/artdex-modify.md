# Modifying Pools

Remember, your pool is your own. This is one major difference when comparing ArtDEX pools to classic token DEX pools. You may change **any parameter** for your pool, except the underlying pool type. 

Use the **My Pools** switch under the pools tab to find your pools. Click or tap the pool to open up details.

Once you've opened up your pool, you'll be able to manage your pool's assets and it's parameters.

## Manage Assets

<p align="center"><img src="/artdex-pool-assets.png" /></p>

You can deposit or withdraw assets from your pool at any time. Providing liquidity is **at-will**, meaning there is absolutely no locking of your assets at any time.

Use the Deposit and Withdraw buttons to manage either XTZ or NFTs.

### Manage NFTs

**Deposit**: Select NFTs from your wallet to deposit.

**Withdraw**: Select NFTs from the pool to recover.

### Manage Tokens

Choose how many tokens to add or remove from your pool.

## Modify Parameters

Modifying the **Spot Price, Delta, & Fee** is a quick way to make wholesale changes directly in your pool without creating a new one.

Click or tap **Modify** to open the form.

<p align="center"><img height="600px" src="/artdex-pool-params-form.png" /></p>

This process is similar to the process defined in the [Create Pool](/artdex-pools#spot-price) section on parameters. 

You'll see the current values for your pool above the new inputs. Leave the fields blank if you don't want to modify the parameter.

Click **Estimate >** to test out changes to your pool.

<p align="center"><img height="600px" src="/artdex-pool-params-modify-btn.png" /></p>

Verify that the desired parameters will be modified by checking the **Modify:** button.

Click or tap **Modify:** and a new transaction will be put in your cart.
